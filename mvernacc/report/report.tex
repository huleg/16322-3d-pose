% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{algorithmicx}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.

% *** Other packages ***
\usepackage{siunitx}
\usepackage{algpseudocode}
\usepackage{algorithm}
\usepackage{physics}

% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\section{Introduction}
The estimation of an object's 3D pose (rotation and translation) relative to a global reference frame is an important problem in robotics and aerospace engineering. This estimation task is called navigation. Satellites, launch vehicles, manned aircraft and UAVs need pose information in order to control their trajectories and to point sensors, communications equipment and weapons at targets. In this project, I restrict the navigation task to estimating rotation only.\\

Two broad classes of sensors are used in navigation: proprioceptive and exteroceptive \cite{Trawny05quat,Kelly-2010-711}. Proprioceptive sensors measure quantities internal to the robot or vehicle; exteroceptive senors measure the surrounding world.\\

Accelerometers and rate gyroscopes are common proprioceptive sensors; they measure the acceleration and angular velocity of the vehicle body. The sensors detect the effect of non-inertial fictitious forces on the motion of a small system (oscillating mass, spinning wheel, etc.) within the sensor. Typically, three orthogonal gyroscopes and three orthogonal accelerometers are combined into a single device, called a strapdown Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) \cite{UCAM-CL-TR-696}.\\

In articulated robots or vehicles, proprioceptive sensors are also used to sense joint angles and actuator positions.\\

Navigation can be performed by integrating IMU measurements. However, noise and sensor biases cause the integrated estimate to drift over time. Depending on the quality of the sensors, the estimate becomes useless after tens of seconds (MEMS devices) to several hours (navigation-grade IMUs) \cite{UCAM-CL-TR-696}.\\

To correct for drift, exteroceptive measurements are incorporated into the estimate. Exteroceptive navigation sensors include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Field sensors} measure orientation relative to a vector field which has a known direction in the global frame. Magnetometers measure the Earth's magnetic field, and accelerometers can measure the gravitational field (on a non-free-falling vehicle). Note that these sensors cannot detect rotation about the vector, e.g. a gravitational sensor cannot provide yaw/heading information.

  \item \emph{Beacon/Landmark sensors} measure the range and/or bearing to a set of beacons. Examples include Sun sensors \cite{sun-sense}, GPS/GNSS, and LORAN.

  \item \emph{Mapping sensors} sense nearby visual or shape features and match them to a map of the environment. Cameras, LiDAR, and ultrasound rangefinders have been used for mapping. The map can be known a priori, or the estimator can perform simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) \cite{AHuangISRR11}.

  \item \emph{Odometry sensors} measure the incremental motion of the vehicle relative to the environment. On wheeled vehicles, encoders are used to count wheel revolutions. \emph{Visual odometry} uses optical flow algorithms to compute motion from camera data \cite{Dille_2009_6430}.
\end{itemize}

In this project, I use an IMU and magnetometer.\\

Several estimators are used in navigation, generally depending on which sensors are available. Non-linear Kalman filters are the typical choice for systems with field, beacon and odometry sensors. Kalman filters work well for systems with approximately Gaussian sensor noise, which these sensors usually have. Mapping sensors require more sophisticated estimators because their measurement distributions are non-Gaussian (e.g. an environment with several similar-looking regions will produce a multi-modal distribution), particle filters are often used in this case.\\

 In this project, I will use an Unscented Kalman filter (UKF). I choose the UKF over the Extended Kalman filter because it offers superior covariance estimation, and avoid the need to determine the Jacobians of the state transition and measurement functions.\\ 

\section{Hardware}
For my sensors, I use an MPU-9150 from InvenSense \cite{mpu9150}. SparkFun Electronics sells the sensor conveniently mounted on a breakout board (part number SEN-11486). The MPU-9150 contains a 3-axis MEMS rate gyro, 3-axis MEMS accelerometer, and a 3-axis Hall effect magnetometer.\\
For computation I use a BeagleBone Black single board computer from Texas Instruments.\\

\section{Coordinate Systems}
I reference the following coordinate systems in my project. The notation for vectors is $\vec{r}^{A}$ indicates that a vector is written in frame A. The notation for quaternions is $q_{A2B}$ indicates the rotation which transforms vectors from frame A to B.
\begin{equation}
  \vec{r}^{B} = \textproc{RotateFrame}(\vec{r}^{A}, q_{A2B})
\end{equation}

\subsection{North East Down (NED)}
The North-East-Down frame is an inertial, Cartesian, right-handed coordinate system.
\begin{itemize}
  \item The origin is at the location of the sensor (I am only considering rotations, not translations of the sensor).
  \item The $x$ axis lies in the horizontal plane (i.e. locally tangent to the WGS84 ellipsoid) and points towards geographic (not magnetic) North.
  \item The $z$ axis points towards the center of the Earth.
  \item The $y$ axis completes the right-handed system.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Sensor}
The sensor frame is a non-inertial, Cartesian, right-handed coordinate system. The estimation task is to determine the rotation of the sensor frame relative to the NED frame

\section{Sensor Models}
\subsection{Accelerometer}
I model the MEMS accelerometer measurement function as
\begin{multline}
  \vec{a}_{meas}^{sensor}(t) = \textproc{RotateFrame}(\vec{g}_{Earth}^{NED}, q_{NED2sensor}(t)) \\
  + \vec{\nu}_{accel}(t)
\end{multline}
where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\vec{a}_{meas}^{sensor}(t)$ is the acceleration measured in the sensor frame at time $t$.
  \item $\vec{g}_{Earth}^{NED} = [0, 0, \SI{9.81}{\meter\per\second\squared}]$ is the Earth's gravitational field in the NED frame.
  \item $q_{NED2sensor}(t)$ is the rotation from the NED frame to the sensor frame at time $t$.
  \item $\nu_{accel}(t)$ is the accelerometer measurement noise.
\end{itemize}

Compared to the magnitude of the acceleration due to gravity, the bias of MEMS accelerometers is typically quite small \cite{mpu9150, UCAM-CL-TR-696}. Therefore I do not include bias terms in my accelerometer model. Further, I assume that the sensor only undergoes rotation, not translation. Any accidental accelerations (e.g. shaking of the sensor during rotation, centripetal acceleration) are modeled as noise. I mounted the sensor near the body's center of mass to minimize centripetal acceleration.\\

The measurement noise is draw from
\begin{equation}
  \vec{\nu}_{accel} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \sigma_{accel,d,x}^2 & 0 & 0 \\
     0 & \sigma_{accel,d,y}^2 & 0 \\
     0 & 0 & \sigma_{accel,d,z}^2 \\
    \end{bmatrix}
  )
\end{equation}
The measurement noise standard deviation is typically specified as a continuous-time Fourier spectral density $\sigma_{accel,c,*}$, with units of \si{\meter\per\second\squared\sqrt\second}. This can be converted to discrete time via:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:cont_to_desc_noise}
  \sigma_{accel,d,*} = \sigma_{accel,c,*} \frac{1}{\sqrt{\Delta t}}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta t$ is the sampling time interval \cite{1642588}.


\subsection{Rate Gyroscope}
I model the MEMS rate gyroscope measurement function as \cite{1642588}:
\begin{equation}
  \vec{\omega}_{meas}^{sensor}(t) = \vec{\omega}^{sensor}(t) + \vec{d} + \vec{b}(t) + \vec{\nu}_{gyro}(t)
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\vec{\omega}_{meas}^{sensor}(t)$ is the angular rate measured in the sensor frame at time $t$.
  \item $\vec{\omega}^{sensor}(t)$ is the true angular rate of the sensor with respect to an inertial frame, at time $t$.
  \item $\vec{d}$ is a constant bias.
  \item $\vec{b}(t)$ is a time-evolving bias.
  \item $\nu_{gyro}(t)$ is the gyro measurement noise.
\end{itemize}

I model the evolution of the bias as a stationary Gauss-Markov process \cite{1642588, park}:
\begin{equation}
  \dv{b}{t} = - \alpha b(t) + \vec{\eta_u}(t)
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ is the inverse of the correlation time, and $\vec{\eta_u}(t)$ is the zero mean Gaussian bias walk noise. The sensor's correlation time and bias walk noise standard deviation are estimated in section \ref{sensor_char}.


\subsection{Magnetometer}
I model the magnetometer measurement function as:
\begin{multline}
  \vec{h}_{meas}^{sensor}(t) = \textproc{RotateFrame}(\vec{h}_{Earth}^{NED} + \vec{h}_{bias}^{NED}, q_{NED2sensor}(t)) \\
  + \vec{h}_{bias}^{sensor} + \vec{\nu}_{mag}(t)
\end{multline}
where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\vec{h}_{meas}^{sensor}(t)$ is the magnetic field measured in the sensor frame at time $t$.
  \item $\vec{h}_{Earth}^{NED}$ is the Earth's magnetic field in the NED frame. This value varies with time and geographic location. In Cambridge, MA in 2015, it is $\vec{h}_{Earth}^{NED} = [\SI{19.5}{\micro\tesla}, \SI{-5.1}{\micro\tesla}, \SI{48.2}{\micro\tesla}]$ \cite{wmm}.
  \item $\vec{h}_{bias}^{NED},$ is a constant bias fixed to the NED frame.
  \item $\vec{h}_{bias}^{sensor},$ is a constant bias which rotates with the sensor.
  \item $\vec{\nu}_{mag}(t)$ is the magnetometer measurement noise.
\end{itemize}


\section{Sensor Characterization}
\label{sensor_char}
I analyzed the noise properties of my sensors using the Allan variance technique \cite{UCAM-CL-TR-696}. The Allan variance of a signal is computed  according to algorithm \ref{avar}. The Allan variance is computed for a range of averaging times $\tau$, typically $10$ times the measurement interval to $0.1$ times the duration of the signal. The Allan deviation ($\sqrt{\textproc{Avar}(\tau)}$) is then plotted against $\tau$ on a log-log scale.\\

\begin{algorithm}
  \caption{Allan Variance}
  \label{avar}
  \begin{algorithmic}
    \Function{Avar}{$\tau$}
      \State Divide the data into $n$ bins of time length $\tau$
      \For{each bin $b_i$}
        \State $a_i \gets \Call{mean}{b_i}$
      \EndFor
      \State \Return $\frac{1}{2 (n-1)} \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (a_{i+1} - a_{i})^2$
      \EndFunction
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

The resulting Allan deviation plot has the general shape shown in figure \ref{allan_regions}. Given the time scales of my measurements, I expect to capture the white noise and bias stability regions. \\
The values of the sensor's noise parameters can be read from the Allan Deviation plots. The continuous-time measurement noise Fourier spectral density $\sigma_{*,c,*}$ is the value at which the linear $-0.5$ slope portion of the plot passes through $\tau = \SI{1}{\second}$ \cite{UCAM-CL-TR-696}. I perform a linear best fit on the Allan Deviation for $\tau \in [\SI{0.1}{\second}, \SI{10}{\second}]$, and find the value of the best-fit line at $\tau = \SI{1}{\second}$. For comparison, I also compute the discrete-time measurement noise $\sigma_{*,d,*}$ by taking the standard deviation of the signal. The results of both calculations are presented in table \ref{table:measurement_noise}. For all sensors, the continuous- and discrete-time noise estimates are in agreement, i.e. equation \ref{eqn:cont_to_desc_noise} is approximately correct.\\
